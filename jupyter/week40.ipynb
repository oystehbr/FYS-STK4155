    "\n",
    "## Batches and mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient descent we compute the cost function and its gradient for all data points we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "In large-scale applications such as the [ILSVRC challenge](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), the\n",
    "training data can have on order of millions of examples. Hence, it\n",
    "seems wasteful to compute the full cost function over the entire\n",
    "training set in order to perform only a single parameter update. A\n",
    "very common approach to addressing this challenge is to compute the\n",
    "gradient over batches of the training data. For example, in current\n",
    "a typical batch could contain some thousand  examples from\n",
    "an  entire training set of several millions. This batch is then used to\n",
    "perform a parameter update.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In stochastic gradient descent, the extreme case is the case where we\n",
    "have only one batch, that is we include the whole data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called Stochastic Gradient\n",
    "Descent (SGD) (or also sometimes on-line gradient descent). This is\n",
    "relatively less common to see because in practice due to vectorized\n",
    "code optimizations it can be computationally much more efficient to\n",
    "evaluate the gradient for 100 examples, than the gradient for one\n",
    "example 100 times. Even though SGD technically refers to using a\n",
    "single example at a time to evaluate the gradient, you will hear\n",
    "people use the term SGD even when referring to mini-batch gradient\n",
    "descent (i.e. mentions of MGD for “Minibatch Gradient Descent”, or BGD\n",
    "for “Batch gradient descent” are rare to see), where it is usually\n",
    "assumed that mini-batches are used. The size of the mini-batch is a\n",
    "hyperparameter but it is not very common to cross-validate or bootstrap it. It is\n",
    "usually based on memory constraints (if any), or set to some value,\n",
    "e.g. 32, 64 or 128. We use powers of 2 in practice because many\n",
    "vectorized operation implementations work faster when their inputs are\n",
    "sized in powers of 2.\n",

    "reasonable time such that we do not move at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let $e = 0,1,2,3,\\cdots$ denote the current epoch and let $t_0, t_1 > 0$ be two fixed numbers. Furthermore, let $t = e \\cdot m + i$ where $m$ is the number of minibatches and $i=0,\\cdots,m-1$. Then the function $$\\gamma_j(t; t_0, t_1) = \\frac{t_0}{t+t_1} $$ goes to zero as the number of epochs gets large. I.e. we start with a step length $\\gamma_j (0; t_0, t_1) = t_0/t_1$ which decays in *time* $t$.\n",

    "In this way we can fix the number of epochs, compute $\\beta$ and\n",
    "evaluate the cost function at the end. Repeating the computation will\n",

    "## Practical tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Randomize the data when making mini-batches**. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transform your inputs**. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Monitor the out-of-sample performance.** Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization.** Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.\n",

    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or nodes or units.  We will\n",
    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",
    "neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",
    "neuron interact with other neurons by sending signals in the form of\n",
    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",
    "visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern between\n",
    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",
    "activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why multilayer perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward\n",
    "neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite\n",
    "number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional\n",
    "function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for\n",
    "the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and\n",
    "monotonically-increasing continuous function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to\n",
    "the hidden layer, the output nodes are always assumed to be linear, so\n",
    "as to not restrict the range of output values.\n",
