    "## The sensitiveness of the gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent method \n",
    "is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\\gamma_k$. This is due\n",
    "to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \\leq\n",

    "## Convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we want our cost/loss function to be convex(concave).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we give the definition of a convex set: A set $C$ in\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be convex if, for all $x$ and $y$ in $C$ and\n",
    "all $t \\in (0,1)$ , the point $(1 − t)x + ty$ also belongs to\n",
    "C. Geometrically this means that every point on the line segment\n",
    "connecting $x$ and $y$ is in $C$ as discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convex subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals of\n",

    "\n",
    "**Convex function**: Let $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex set. Assume that the function $f: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is said to be convex if $$f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \\leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) $$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ and for all $t \\in [0,1]$. If $\\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \\neq x_2$ and $t\\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions on convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we state first and second-order conditions which\n",
    "ensures convexity of a function $f$. We write $D_f$ to denote the\n",
    "domain of $f$, i.e the subset of $R^n$ where $f$ is defined. For more\n",
    "details and proofs we refer to: [S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Convex Optimization. Cambridge University Press](http://stanford.edu/boyd/cvxbook/, 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "**First order condition.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $f$ is differentiable (i.e $\\nabla f(x)$ is well defined for\n",
    "all $x$ in the domain of $f$). Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$\n",
    "is a convex set and $$f(y) \\geq f(x) + \\nabla f(x)^T (y-x) $$ holds\n",
    "for all $x,y \\in D_f$. This condition means that for a convex function\n",
    "the first order Taylor expansion (right hand side above) at any point\n",
    "a global under estimator of the function. To convince yourself you can\n",
    "make a drawing of $f(x) = x^2+1$ and draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ and\n",
    "note that it is always below the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second order condition.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that $f$ is twice\n",

    "\n",
    "The next result is of great importance to us and the reason why we are\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally we want the\n",
    "global minimum (for high-dimensional models it is hard to know\n",
    "if we have local or global minimum). However, if the cost/loss function\n",
    "is convex the following result provides invaluable information:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any minimum is global for convex functions.**\n",

    "## Some simple problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ using the definition of convexity.

    "3. Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = e^x$. Show that $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is convex for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Also show that if $f(x)$ is any convex function than $h(x) = e^{f(x)}$ is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A norm is any function that satisfy the following properties\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(\\alpha x) = |\\alpha| f(x)$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(x+y) \\leq f(x) + f(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ with equality if and only if $x = 0$\n",

    "## Using gradient descent methods, limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function**. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our cost/loss/risk function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is sensitive to initial conditions**. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets**. In many cases in statistics and ML, the cost/loss/risk function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called \"mini batches\". This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates**. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly.** Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.  This leads us to our next topic, Stochastic Gradient Methods."
