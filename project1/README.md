# Project 1

## Exercise 1 🏎🏎

#### To do 2.1 (moving all files):
**Two existing folders:** folder1, folder2. **One non-existing folder**: folder4

*Here are some examples:*

```bash
./move.sh folder1 folder2 
./move.sh folder1
./move.sh folder4 folder2
```
  1. Result: move every single file/ folder inside folder1 -> (to) folder2
  2. Result: errormessage, since the script needs at least two commmandline arguments
  3. Result: errormessage, since the "from"-directory do not exist, it will exit
