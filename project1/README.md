#### exercise1.py 🏎🏎
    - Performing an OLS analysis using polynomials in x and y
    - Find the confidence intervals of the parameters beta (printing them out in nice format)
    - Evaluating the Mean Squared error (MSE)
    - Evaluating the R^2 score

#### exercise2.py 👞👢
    - Want to plot MSE vs complexity, with both the training and testing data
    - Perform a bias-variance analysis of the Franke function, MSE vs complexity

#### exercise3.py 🙅🏼❌
    - Compare the MSE you get from cross-validation with the one from bootstrap (print out)

#### exercise4.py 🌉🌁 (RIDGE)
    - Perform the same bootstrap analysis (mse vs complexity) as in exercise 2
    - Perform cross-validation as in exercise 3 (different values of lmbda)
    - Perform a bias-variance analysis (MSE vs lmbda)


#### exercise5.py 🤠🪢 (LASSO)
    - Perform the same bootstrap analysis (mse vs complexity) as in exercise 2
    - Perform cross-validation as in exercise 3 (different values of lmbda)
    - Perform a bias-variance analysis (MSE vs lmbda)

#### exercise6.py 🗾🧭
