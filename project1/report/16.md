## Exercise 1
I think your theoretical presentation of the problem is very nice and organized, however, you have not actually presented your results!
When running test_project_1.py, i also only see the result for a single polynomial, when we asked of you to study the behavior of polynomials up to a degree of 5.
These are unfortunate mistakes, because your theoretical discussion and code seems to imply a solid understanding.

Score: 7/10 points

## Exercise 2 
Very good!

Score: 15/15 points

## Exercise 3
Good discussion, but again, it is very difficult for me to judge it since i can't see the data from which you are drawing your conclusions!
As a note: looking at your code it does not look like your CV function shuffles the data before splitting. This shouldn't pose a problem for your Franke function results since you sample your points in a random way from a uniform distribution.  But if your dataset is ordered in any way, then you would need to shuffle!

Score: 12/15 points

## Exercise 4
Here you have included some of your data, which is good. However, i would like some more detail as to how the data was generated. 
Guide the reader through your work!

Score: 18/20 points

## Exercise 5
What lambda did you use in your critical discussion (Figs 10,11)? This is important information that impacts your discussion. Would different choices of lambda affect your conclusions in any way?
Else, your discussion here is quite good.

Score: 8/10 points

## Exercise 6
### Exercise 1 (repeat)
How did you choose a polynomial of degree 6? did you try anything else as well? if so; show your data!
### Exercise 2 (repeat)
Which plot? Please refer to your plots by their figure number ie "In Fig.X we see ...", this is especially important when the figure is not placed in an "obvious" location, as is rarely the case in LaTeX. 
But your discussion is good, especially that explained the discrepancy with your Franke results with the number of data points in the terrain data!
### Exercise 3 (repeat)
Show your results!
### Exercise 4 (repeat)
Fig. 15: How did you choose your lambda for ridge regression?
Fig. 16: How many folds did you use in your cross-validation? What degree polynomial did you use?
### Exercise 5 (repeat)
Fig. 18: Did you try any other degrees? A 2nd order polynomial seems like a rather inflexible model for terrain data. Anyway, you should justify/discuss your choice!
### Critical discussions of the three methods
Nice discussion, great that you spotted that the large number of datapoints in the terrain data prevents you from observing overfitting for low-order polynomials and that you then investigated a smaller dataset as well. But you should specify the value of the penalty parameter used in Ridge and LASSO!
NOTE: Figs 20-25: When making small figures, please adjust the figure sizes using i.e plt.figure(figsize=[width,height]) to make the text readable and its features distinguishable. I won't deduct points for it, but please keep it in mind for projects 2 and 3!

Score: 20/30 points

## Overall Impression
Your discussion is clear and concise, and shows a good understanding of the material. However, it is also very important to show data/plots to convince the reader that your interpretation/discussion is sound! Also make sure you specify what models you have chosen (order and penalty in this case) and why/how you came to that choice!

I wish you the best of luck with project 2!

Final score : 80/100 points
